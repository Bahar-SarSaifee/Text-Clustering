# Text-Clustering

This notebook uses Unsupervised Learning to cluster the texts from the "BBC News" dataset.
I use the KMeans algorithm to group the vectors generated by the TF-IDF. Then I use Principal Component Analysis to visualize groups.

- Import the "BBC News" dataset
- Data preprocessing
- TF-IDF
- KMeans algorithm
- PCA
- Interpret the dataset
