# Text-Clustering

This notebook uses Unsupervised Learning to cluster the texts from the "BBC News" dataset.
I use the KMeans algorithm to group the vectors generated by the TF-IDF. Then I use Principal Component Analysis to visualize groups.

- import the dataset
- apply preprocessing
- use TF-IDF
- apply KMeans
- apply PCA
- interpret the data
